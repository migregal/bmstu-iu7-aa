# Algorythm Analysis Labs

As you are here give me a star)

## Usage
* `Lab 04` is written in `C`. So all you need is to run `make && make run` in the src dir.
* Other labs are written in `Golang` so you have to use `go run` to run application or explicitly build executable file with `go build`

## Thanks
